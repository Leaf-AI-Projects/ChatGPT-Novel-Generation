# ChatGPT Novel Generation

## Description

Research into exploring ChatGPT's efficacy in writing novels.

## Web Application

Everyone is welcome to test ChatGPT's ability to write a novel! Please follow these steps to create your own ChatGPT-generated novel:

1. [Create an OpenAI account and get an API Key.](https://www.maisieai.com/help/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key-for-chatgpt)

2. Go to [link missing]().

3. Press the API Key button, then paste your OpenAI API Key in the designated input field.

4. Fill out the details for the novel you would like to be generated.

5. The application will use iteration and strategic prompting to create a novel-length text.

6. A pdf will automatically be downloaded whenever the loading bar gets to 100%.

7. Feel free to leave feedback about the quality of the produced text [via email](https://coleb.io/contact).

## Note

- The application **never** stores or uses your API Key outside of your own prompts. All of the code in this repository is public.
- The application uses gpt-4o-mini for the vast majority of prompts. Most prompts total out between 2 - 15 cents.
